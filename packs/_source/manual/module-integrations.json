A pile of items, something to interact with - or perhaps chests whose appearance changes depending on what happens to it, whether it's open, closed, full, or empty. Do you want an easy way to split loot between players? Do you want easy to use merchants with great UIs?</p><p>Then you need <strong>Item Piles</strong>!</p><h2>Party Overview</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/draconas1/foundry-4e-tools\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/party-overview</a></p><p>Has built in 4E integration</p><h2>Token Action HUD Classic</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/Drental/fvtt-tokenactionhud\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud</a></p><p>Has an inbuilt integration written by Draconas</p><p>For rolling checks you can shift-click on the token action button to get a quick roll.</p><p>Right clicking on conditions get the condition as a big icon</p><p>Right clicking on powers and features gets the popup, left click rolls.</p><p>There are many settings to configure your D&amp;D 4E Token Action HUD experience. They are hard to spot as token Action HUD does not separate its settings. Under module settings, look for:</p><ul><li>Show Conditions Category</li><li>Hide Used Powers</li><li>Colour Powers by Use</li><li>Hide Unequipped Inventory</li><li>Hide Inventory with quantity of 0</li><li><p>Visible Inventory Categories</p><ul><li>The complete list is: 'weapon, equipment, consumable, tool, backpack, loot, alchemical, ammo, potion, poison, food, scroll, trinket'</li></ul></li></ul><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Token Action HUD Classic is no longer being actively developed for new versions of foundry. It does currently work with the latest version (V11) and at the moment the 4e system does not have a module developed for Token Action HUD Core.</em></p>",
