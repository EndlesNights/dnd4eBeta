        "content": "<p>Your Inventory tab contains subsections for the various weapons and implements, slot-based equipment, magical trinkets, single-use items, and whatever other miscellaneous junk an adventurer might squirrel away. Note that the sections here don't map perfectly onto 4e's item categories, as they are based specifically on mechanical implementation.</p><p>Aside from the very top section, which tracks currencies, each subsection has a common set of controls:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Icon:</strong> Click a item's icon to \"use\" it. This sends its power card to chat, andâif the item has an activated effectâalso triggers the relevant roll or dialogue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Name:</strong> Click on an item's name to expand/collapse its details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buttons:</strong> Use the edit and delete buttons at the end of the row to manage existing items. You can also click the button with a <strong>shield icon</strong> to toggle whether an item is currently equipped. (This is available for all items, although it can safely be ignored for things like consumables.)</p></li></ul><h2>Currency</h2><p>Currency and Ritual components track your various currencies and can be accessed as character sheet attributes. This lets you tie ritual casting to the relevant component.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Lists the weapons and implements carried by the character.</p><p>Creating weapons is detailed enough to warrant its own manual page: @UUID[.yvcLeBP3ma2lNrxN]{Creating Weapons}</p><h2>Equipment</h2><img style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto\" src=\"systems/dnd4e/icons/manual-images/equipment.jpg\" width=\"669\" height=\"579\" /><p>For the purposes of Foundry, equipment is any gear aside from weapons and implements which is worn or equipped in order to gain its effect, usually in a specific body slot. Equipment has some specific fields on its detail tab for entering the most common bonusesâsuch as to defences and resistancesâand for the drawbacks typically associated with armour and shields.</p><p>Equipment only gives its benefit if it is set to <em>equipped</em> and <em>proficient</em>. <strong>If armour is not set as proficient, it will apply a -2 attack penalty. If a shield is not set as proficient it will not apply a defence bonus.</strong></p><p>When assigning armour penalties to skills and movement speed, it does not matter if you specify a positive or negative value, it will be applied as a penalty.</p><p>If the equipment gives damage resistance, you can add it on here by clicking the + icon. Specify the value (positive for resistance, negative for vulnerability) and select the damage type from the dropdown.</p><h3>Equipment and Item Powers</h3><p>Unfortunately, Equipment items cannot contain activated powers. If you have a piece of equipment that uses <strong>a specific slot </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> has an activated power</strong>, you will need to create a separate Power with the \"Item\" type, and add both to the character.</p><p>However, if you have a Wondrous Item (ie, slotless) with an activated power, you can avoid having to create a separate power if you create it as a rechargeable Consumable (see below) instead.</p><p>A Wondrous Item with only a static benefit (such as you would create with an Active Effect) is probably best modelled by an Equipment item that uses \"Other\" for its slot.</p><h2>Consumables</h2><p>This category contains everything from food, to ammo, to potions and alchemical items. Consumables differ from most other inventory in that they have activation effectsâthey can roll like a power.</p><p>As the name implies, these are typically items that are consumed or destroyed when used, like potions. However, since the item can also be rechargeable, this can also be a good way to model wondrous items with a single activated power.</p><p>If you click a consumable's icon in the table, you will get a consumption dialog before the relevant chat messages are output and resources consumed.</p><h3>Consumable Usage</h3><img style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto\" src=\"systems/dnd4e/icons/manual-images/consumable-use.jpg\" width=\"579\" height=\"121\" /><p>Probably the most important section, this determines how a consumable gets used up. The most common setting is for chargesâie, each consumable has a number of charges that once they are gone, are gone. When you run out of charges, one of that consumable is used up and the number you have is decreased.</p><p>This means the most common setting is 1/1 charges, with \"destroy on empty\" checked. In this case, 1 consumable is used and gone forever on each activation.</p><p>You can also set <strong>Resource Consumption</strong> for items that use an additional resource upon activation. For example, healing potions usually burn a healing surge.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Example:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd4e.example_character.Actor.BF5aEE8y1e3bh7Jc.Item.umRuMzu4UZsPmzED]{Potion of Minor Healing} on @Compendium[dnd4e.example_character.BF5aEE8y1e3bh7Jc]{Steve} shows this in practice.</p></li></ul><p>For most <strong>ammunition</strong>, The Consumable Usage section is all you need to concern yourself with; you don't generally activate ammunition by itself, but rather you specify it as the resource consumed by your bow.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Example:</strong> See the Shortbow on @Compendium[dnd4e.example_character.BF5aEE8y1e3bh7Jc]{Steve} for an example of using ammunition.</p></li></ul><h3>Consumable Activation</h3><p>Consumables can also roll like a power when activated. For these, you can use the checkboxes to select what kind of roll is requiredâattack, damage, healing or other. These all function the same as the matching roll types in a Power, so will not be covered here.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Example:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd4e.equipmentPack.Item.0ddspnljambxzwyO]{Alchemical Fire Bomb (lvl 1)} is a consumable that makes an attack and damage roll.</p></li></ul><p>To make a reusable wondrous item with an activated power (commonly nicknamed a \"trinket\"), you can set up your Consumable Activation as necessary, and combine it with the following Consumable Usage settings:</p><ul><li><p>Uncheck \"destroy on empty\"</p></li><li><p>Select \"round\"/\"day\"/\"encounter\" from the dropdown instead of instead of \"charges\"</p></li></ul><p>With this configuration, using the consumable will deplete but not destroy it. Its allocated uses will then be restored after an appropriate cooldown.</p><h2>Tools</h2><p>Tools are designed to work with skills or abilities, and the details tab lets you specify which one you would like.</p><p>The function of a tool is simply to roll a skill or ability check with the specified bonus. This is useful for creating items that give a skill bonus specifically when applied to a checkâfor example, a climber's kitârather than giving a permanent bonus.</p><h2>Loot</h2><p>Loot is the catch-all for items that do not have any mechanical effects, and are description only.</p><h2>Containers</h2><p>Currently function like loot. You cannot yet add items to a container.</p><h2>System Provided Templates</h2><h3>SRD ...</h3><p>The SRD Weapons, SRD Armour and SRD Equipment are direct copies of the tables in the PHB, as per the SRD. Grabbing the base weapon from here is an ideal way to start making a magic item.</p><h3>Example ...</h3><p>Example Alchemical Items, Potions and Poisons contain items with the mechanical effects of items published in the SRD. However, they do not use the same names, descriptions or flavour text, as the SRD does not permit these parts to be reproduced verbatim. If you have your rulebooks on hand, it should be easy to see which example items correspond with which published items.</p>",

Referred to in formula as <code>@profbonus</code></p><p><strong>Implement Proficiency Bonus:</strong> (Only shown if the weapon has the implement property) Enter a separate proficiency bonus for when this is used as an implement, if required. Most implements do not have a proficiency bonus, though it is a good place to put the bonus for the Accurate Wand. Referred to in formula as <code>@profImpBonus</code></p><p><strong>Enhancement Bonus: </strong>The weapon's magical enhancement bonus; can be referred to using <code>@enhance</code>. You can also use <code>@enhanceImp</code>, which only returns the value if \"Implement Proficient\" has been ticked. Otherwise, it will be 0.</p><p><strong>Limited Uses:</strong> Can generally be left blank, there are very few weapons that have limited uses</p><p><strong>Resource Consumption: </strong>Mostly for ranged weapons. Select your ammunition here and it will be automatically consumed (and add bonuses if applicable) when the weapon is used.</p><p><strong>Weapon Damage Dice:</strong> These form the core weapon damage (referred to as \"[W]\" in power text). They are not referenced by a variable, but have their own dropdown when creating Powers.</p><p><strong>Extra Modifiers:</strong> These will be inserted into the Foundry dice roll expression directly after the weapon dice, so you can modify the dice roll using Foundry's additional dice commands.</p><p>It is very rare that you will ever want to do this, so it's almost always best to leave this blank. (You might use it for something like the Brutal property, except that Brutal is common enough to have its own setting below).</p><p><strong>Brutal Dice Value:</strong> (Only appears if the brutal property has been selected) Enter the brutal value of the weapon. If left blank this defaults to 1, as most brutal weapons are Brutal 1.</p><p><strong>Critical Hit:</strong> The number that must be rolled on the attack roll to get a critical hit. Usually 20.</p><p><strong>Implement Critical Hit:</strong> The number that must be rolled on the attack roll of an implement attack with this weapon to get a critical hit. Usually 20.</p><h2>Weapon Formula</h2><p>@UUID[.UteMJPMuW11OAKWl]{Possible Variables in Formula} Lists all the possible variables you can use in formula, and what they do.</p><img style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto\" src=\"systems/dnd4e/icons/manual-images/weapon-damage.jpg\" width=\"567\" height=\"510\" /><p><strong>Bonus to Attack Formula:</strong> This is what goes into <code>@wepAttack</code> in power formula. The default (proficiency bonus + enhancement bonus) is correct for most cases.</p><p><strong>Bonus to Primary Damage Formula:</strong> This is what goes into <code>@wepDamage</code> in power formula. The default (enhancement bonus) is correct for most cases.</p><p><strong>Secondary Damage Formula:</strong> If the weapon always does some form of secondary damage on hit (e.g. 1d6 fire damage), you can enter it in a line here. It will be automatically added to damage when you hit.</p><p><strong>Bonus to Critical Damage Formula: </strong>This is what goes into <code>@wepCritBonus</code> in power formulaâthe bonus damage you get on a critical. This defaults to 1d6 per level of magical enhancement which is correct for most weapons. Weapons with the High Crit property, or certain magical weapons (normally \"Brutal\" ones, not to be confused with the Brutal weapon property) will want to tweak this.</p><p><strong>Secondary Critical Damage Formula:</strong> This will be used instead of secondary damage formula on a crit (so from our above fire example, would just be 6 assuming that the secondary damage was also maximised on crit).</p><h2>Weapon Properties</h2><img style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto\" src=\"systems/dnd4e/icons/manual-images/weapon-properties.jpg\" width=\"471\" height=\"467\" /><p>Here you check relevant damage types, properties and groups. Most of these are just used as markers for certain conditional effects.</p><p><strong>Implement:</strong> Enables the implement input boxes above and the implement group below.</p><p><strong>Brutal:</strong> Enables the brutal range box.</p><p><strong>Versatile:</strong> If wielded in 2 hands, applies additional damage.</p><h2>Creating Magic Weapons</h2><p>The easiest way is to take a base weapon, give it a nice new name, set the enhancement bonus and price as appropriate. If the magic weapon also has an activated power attached, you will need to make a separate Item Power and add that to your character as well.</p>",

To do this, create an effect with a modifier whose key begins with @, e.g. <code>@MyCoolBonus</code>. (Note, if you're using autocomplete for inline properties you will need to close the autocomplete dialog.)</p><p>Once the effect is created, you can reference <code>@MyCoolBonus</code> in powers and in active effects (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd4e.manual.JournalEntry.VLRhDKYMBtS0MrJa]{Effects}).</p>",
