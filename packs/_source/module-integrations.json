You need to have both installed and activated to benefit.</li><li>Further integration in other fields may happen later.</li></ul><h3>Automated Animations</h3><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/package/autoanimations\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/package/autoanimations</a></p><p>Provides a UI interface for compiling Sequences (Sequencer Module) to be automatically played in your game system based on name recognition through the Global Automatic Recognition menu.

It began life as the \"Extra Chat Syles\" setting in Fox's 4e Aesthetics, meaning it's designed specifically with 4e in mind.</p><h3>Carousel Combat Tracker</h3><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-tracker-dock\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-tracker-dock</a></p><p>Provides a carousel of combatants to display initiative order and critical information. Integration creates a default attribute display (Defences, Speed, Initiative mod, Max HP and Bloodied value) but you can configure your own if you prefer.</p><h3>Drac’s Foundry 4E Tools</h3><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundry-4e-tools\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundry-4e-tools</a></p><p>An enhancement module for the D&amp;D 4E system that contains a number of useful helpers, utilities and examples.</p><ul><li><strong>Auto-bloodied / dead status:</strong>If a token is reduced to bloodied HP it gets the bloodied icon. Similarly if it gets killed, it gets a dead icon. PC’s get dying icons initially.</li><li><strong>Creature Importer from Masterplan:</strong> Allows the GM to import creatures from the Masterplan application. Creatures import with all stats, powers, auras and ready to go chat descriptions for knowledges</li><li><strong>Sample Macros (Compendium):</strong> A collection of sample Macros for things that people have frequently asked about.</li></ul><h3>Easy Target</h3><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/easy-target\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/easy-target</a></p><p>Lets you quickly target counters under Measured Templates for AOE</p><h3>Fox's 4e Aesthetics</h3><p><a href=\"https://codeberg.org/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling\">https://codeberg.org/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling</a></p><p>Made specifically for D&amp;D4e, it restyles almost the entire system to use the same styling as the D&amp;D 4e books.</p><ul><li>Chat Cards look like the power cards in 4e books</li><li>New journal sheets styled after 4e books with Player, GM and Monster book colour schemes</li><li>Entirely new monster and trap/hazard sheets that lay out monster info as per MM3. (switch between using the \"sheet\" option in the top right)</li><li>Entirely new PC character sheet with a focus on in-play usability and looking really nice. (switch between using the \"sheet\" option in the top right)</li><li>Enhanced tooltips for chat cards</li></ul><h3>Inkpot - Icons</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/kyleady/inkpot-icons\">https://github.com/kyleady/inkpot-icons</a></p><p>A module that contains ~50,000 dalle-mini generated icons specifically for D&amp;D4e.</p><h3>Inkpot - Power Roll</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/kyleady/inkpot-powerroll\">https://github.com/kyleady/inkpot-powerroll</a></p><p>A module made specifically for D&amp;D4e that can make inline rollable links when inside double square brackets with a /p at the start</p><ul><li><code>[[/p Dex vs AC]]</code></li><li><code>[[/p 1[W] + Constitution radiant and necrotic damage]]</code></li><li><code>[[/p spend a healing surge and regain an additional d6 hit points]]</code></li><li><code>[[/p Petrified (save ends)]]</code></li><li><code>[[/p Augment 1]]</code></li></ul><h3>Item Piles</h3><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/package/item-piles\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/package/item-piles</a></p><p>Have you ever wished you could represent items in your scenes? A pile of items, something to interact with - or perhaps chests whose appearance changes depending on what happens to it, whether it's open, closed, full, or empty. Do you want an easy way to split loot between players? Do you want easy to use merchants with great UIs?</p><p>Then you need <strong>Item Piles</strong>!</p><h3>Party Overview</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/draconas1/foundry-4e-tools\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/party-overview</a></p><p>Provides a basic sheet summarising the party and their attributes (key stats, wealth, spoken languages).</p><h3>Token Action HUD Core + TAH 4e</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/Larkinabout/fvtt-token-action-hud-core\">https://github.com/Larkinabout/fvtt-token-action-hud-core</a> + <a href=\"https://github.com/draconas1/token-action-hud-dnd4e\">https://github.com/draconas1/token-action-hud-dnd4e</a></p><p>Creates a HUD bar—similar to the macro bar—with expandable categories for just about every \"normal\" roll you might want to make (power, skill ability checks, conditions, static feature summaries, etc). Extremely valuable if you want to play the game without constantly needing to pop open character sheets or keep them in a sidebar.</p><ul><li>TAH Core is installed as a base, then integrated via the system-specific module provided by Draconas (the second link above)</li><li>For rolling checks you can shift-click on the token action button to get a quick roll.</li><li>Right clicking on conditions get the condition as a big icon</li><li>Right clicking on powers and features gets the popup, left click rolls.</li></ul><p>There are many settings to configure your D&amp;D 4E Token Action HUD experience. They are hard to spot as token Action HUD does not separate its settings. Under module settings, look for:</p><ul><li>Show Conditions Category</li><li>Hide Used Powers</li><li>Colour Powers by Use</li><li>Hide Unequipped Inventory</li><li>Hide Inventory with quantity of 0</li><li><p>Visible Inventory Categories</p><ul><li>The complete list is: 'weapon, equipment, consumable, tool, backpack, loot, alchemical, ammo, potion, poison, food, scroll, trinket'</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Previous Versions</h2><h3>Active Auras</h3><p><strong>(FVTT 12) </strong><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ActiveAuras\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ActiveAuras</a></p><p>Allows you to turn an Active Effect into an Aura, imposing almost any valid Active Effect onto character within the specified radius.</p><p>Features integration contributed by Fox Lee to use the correct 4e distance measurement, and check creature type/origin/subtype when determining targets from the user-specified list.</p><h3>Drag Ruler</h3><p><strong>(FVTT11)</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/draconas1/foundry-4e-tools\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler</a></p><p>Measures the potential movement of tokens on the grid. While you are dragging a token, the ruler displays the number of squares you're trying move and compares it visually with your move, run, double move and double run values.</p><ul><li>Integration is via Drac’s Foundry 4E Tools (below). You need to have both installed and activated to benefit.</li></ul><h3>Token Action HUD Classic</h3><p><strong>(FVTT 11)</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Drental/fvtt-tokenactionhud\">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud</a></p><p>For very old installations, you will need to replace TAH Core with TAH Classic. This version has integration written by Draconas.</p>",
