## Description
An implementation for the 4th Edition of Everyone's Favourite Cave Spelunking, and Wyvern Slaying, Fantasy Role Playing Game System for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) in accordance to the [4th Edition System Reference Document](http://weirdzine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4E_SRD-1.pdf). This system hopes to provide a basis that eases some of the cruncher side of 4th Edition, by providing a feature rich character sheet and some basic automation both inside of and outside of combat.
