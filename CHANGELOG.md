  - Fix for core issue https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/11527 (fixes #419 and another report I had on Discord of heritage bonuses not stacking correctly). Looks like Foundry intends to fix this only in v13, so I stole this temporary fix from [Black Flag](https://github.com/koboldpress/black-flag/commit/d816b843d6702b0d5cecbdcfc765918002394b4e#diff-be8a125e28ef90b1367be003410b96d6e74779a15771b893370e4b260422d375), blessings upon them.

## Version 0.5.8
- [PR 404](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/404) from [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)
  - Fixes a bug where attack rolls from creatures with a global attack bonus throw an error; this was due to a mistake where weapon proficiency was checked even for powers with "none" weapon requirement.
  - Fixes the bug causing defences of NPCs not using advancedCals to be much too high.
  - Updates NPC sheet to display current defence values alongside base values.
  - Fixes an "object Object" dropdown in equipment limited use intervals (#401)
  - Updates initiative tiebreaker to a selection between init mod (system), dex score (houserule), or random.

## Version 0.5.6
- Hotfix for a bug with situational bonus value #398 

## Version 0.5.5
- Many fixes [PR 393](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/393) from [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)
	- Updated references to certain properties in the damage rolled from chat cards (fixes #390). I also changed the fallback behaviour for unspecified damage, which seemed like it should use physical instead of true damage.
	- Updated references to certain properties in active effect config (Fixes #383)
	- Added new logic for bonus keys based on the defence targeted by a power (as suggested by absolitude on the Discord). Yay for low-hanging fruit! :p
	- Since the v12 editions expand many single-string configs into objects, I took the liberty of adding short and abbreviated labels to ability action types (eg. "Standard" vs. "Standard Action" and "STD."). Also added strings accordingly in the EN and AN-AU lang files, and corrected some mistakes in strings for auto-apply effect settings.
	- Updated various templates to newer Handlebars. (Not actually required until v14, but I got sick of so many warnings so I got rid of some easy ones while I was working on nearby stuff.)
	- Increased the height of the description field in active effects config form, to make it a bit more usable (also suggested by absolitude on the Discord).
		- Addtioanl Change was made so the height should scale with addtional space within the form as it is scaled.

	- Changed effect suppression logic on equipment, which was excluding effects without Actor sources, instead of effects without item sources. (Fixes #387).
	- Fixed custom skills hook as suggested by ddbrown30 (Fixes #391)
	- Enabled that "global skill modifier" field that's been floating around on character sheets for a while. (Includes a migration script, so that will need to be activated once merged.)

	- Added a global defences modifier, on the basis that while it's not too hard to add bonuses to four defences manually, it does come up _really_ frequently so it would probably be appreciated. It's compared to the bonus types for individual defences, so should respect 4e stacking rules.
	- Added an "isBasic" property for attacks, which can be targeted with the "basic" bonus key. I meant to add a marker on the power listing as well, but I forgot. I _did_ also update Steve and the SRD powers compendium, I just haven't uploaded them yet because uploading "packs" is a PITA now and if I untangle the global attack/damage bonus types issue before I'm done on this tear, they'll need updates again anyway.
	
- Many fixes [PR 396](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/396) from [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)
	- Updated custom effect handling to apply type stacking rules to global atk/dmg bonuses
	- Removed `@atkMod` and`@dmgMod` from default formulae, and updated migration to remove them from existing powers.
	- Updated ongoing damage automation. GM account perform all ongoing damage logic.
	- Updated document owner detection to prioritise an assigned player before checking owner permissions. This solves an issue I ran into where it would always fall back to a GM if player ownership is all default, even there was a currently assigned player.
	
- css fix encumbrance bar height
- Rework active effect tooltip on character sheets to show description text.
- fixed issue that was causing Automated Animations to hang up

- updated French Language courtesy of [Gilphe](https://github.com/Gilphe)

## Version 0.5.4
- Added healing option of 'Cost Healing Surge" option to healing. This can be used in examples such as with healing potions which take a healing surge,  but only grant a flat amount of hitpoints. When rolling you can manually include this amount with the tag `[surgeCost]`, this still expand a surge on the take when applied.
- fixed an issue where the current HP value on character sheets would lock from active effects

## Version 0.5.3

- Another fix of Inherent Enhancements [PR 372](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/372) from [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)

- ## Version 0.4.57
- fixed issue with default sorting not being working properly, which caused issues with types of item documents being created on actors.

- added missing keyword "Shadow"
- minor CSS changes,
	- edit to power rich editor for effect text 
	- change to power card highlighting, every element now contains the css class `alt-highlight` which will alternate highlighting
	- minor change to how effect html rich text is combined into the power cards <p class="effect"> element, with the first paragraph <p> element being merged together as to not create unintended spaces and highlighting

## Version 0.4.56
- added error checking to ActorSheet4e#_onConvertCurrency incase of undefined value

## Version 0.4.55
- update to french lang
- Minor change to CSS selector, making item card class selectors slightly more specific as to cause destructive interference with modules. (spesificly fixed an issue with Monks Enhanced Journal)

## Version 0.4.54

- Fixed CSS/HTMl for Equipment Sheets Damage Resistances & Immunity + Enhancement overlap spacing fix

## Version 0.4.53
- minor html/css tweak to rework Attack Roll chat messages
- [PR 357](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/357) from [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)
	- [Added 2024-05-25] Un-broke how I broke enhancement bonuses when inherent bonuses are off.
	- Corrects an oversight where res/vuln could have crossed 0 on the number line and messed things up
	- Exposes the priority of changes within effects for user management; allows for correct timing of (for example) penalties on upgrade effects.
	- Updates the Manual compendium to discuss change modes and priority with examples (and info about defaults required for correct timing)
	- Adds "Action (modern)" as a power grouping method on character sheets; it's a simplified (MM3-esque) grouping that's like Action, but bundles all triggered actions together. (Sorry, this is new functionality and I should have kept it separate from the fixes, but working in the same files made it hard to separate out).

## Version 0.4.52
- Added global skill bonus which can be acsessed by active effects at `@system.modifiers.skills.<type>`
- fixed some missing i18n
- minor CSS fix
- Refactors for TAH integration [PR 356](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/356) from [draconas1](https://github.com/draconas1)

- [PR 355](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/355) from [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)
	- Updated handling of resistances (#327). The `value` property is now derived from two other properties, `res` and `vuln`. Effects should be directed to modify these properties instead of `value` and respect apply modes. Effects using other keys (like the 4e bonus types) should be updated by the user, but if any are still found they are filtered into `res` or `vuln` based on if they are positive or negative. Manual bonuses (as in, entered through the sheet) are all applied as-is.
	- Added inherent enhancement bonuses as a game-wide setting (#88). When it's on, the calcs for defences, attack and damage will check against the scaling bonuses suggested in the PHB2/Darksun books and override the existing bonus if it's too low. (PCs only)
	- Updated equipment model/sheet to separate out enhancement bonuses from non-magical bonuses. Non-magical bonuses and other armour properties are now hidden on non-armour items, and an enhancement bonus section appears for armour and neck items.
	- I found the migration scripts! So I've included one to add the new properties to older items/actors. It will also look for neck "armour" items with identical fort/ref/will values, and move the shared value to "enhance" instead.
	- Added "shield" as a bonus type to the template for all defences. The mundane bonuses to defences on shield-typed equipment are now re-routed to this property instead of "armour". (#344)
	- Added "none" weapon hand option (for slotless implements) (#354)
	- Plugged the auto-generated power summaries on character sheets into the same "enrichment" function that the description field uses in manual descriptions, in order to benefit from variable substitution and calculation. Astonishingly, it appears to work without issue.
	- Added a bonus key for one-handed weapons (#353) and updated documentation to include it.
	- Added the kusari-gama to the base weapons list, which I previously left out for some reason.
	- Updated Steve, the SRD features compendium, and the Manual compendium accordingly.

	- Darkmode
	- template files cleaned up
	- revised CSS files
	- revised character sheet item description toggle to respect description/chat flavour/auto generate combination as per chat card generation. This prevents both the description and chat flavour being output when auto-generate cards is on.
	- revised character and item sheets, I've updated the HTML fields to use ProseMirror as the editor. This is because TinyMCE uses iframes (which prevent styling) and therefore really messes up dark mode.

	- disabled inputs show a "disabled" cursor on hover.
	- NPC sheet revised upper section to better match the style of PC sheets and prioritise information used during combat. This includes converting the "advanced maths" checkbox to a button in the header.
	- added translatable strings for the names of sheets and item types. Foundry was excepting these and defaulting to IDs when it didn't find them, which just made things seem a bit haphazard.

	- Updated the Manual & Help Compendium—mostly for the sake of adding a section about ongoing damage, but while I was there I made a bunch of smaller updates and typo fixes too. Please see the commit for more details!
	- Removed (most) inline formatting from the Manual and added it as default journal CSS instead, with the goal of making the manual a lot more friendly to journal enhancements.
	- Added a tooltip to the new "show image" button on an actor's portrait.

- Number of data fixes seen in the following [merge](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/177) from [draconas1](https://github.com/draconas1) This could have been a patch on its own!
- refactor to prepareData()
- new helper formula calls to help with all sorts of power or feat formulas that scale from tiers 
	@heroic, returns value of 1 if character level is less than 11, else zero
	@paragon, returns value of 1 if character level is or is between 11 and 20, else zero
	@Epic, returns a value of 1 if character level is 21 or higher, else zero,
	@heroicOrParagon, if @heroic or @paragon are true, return 1 else zero
	@paragonOrEpic, if @paragon or @epic are true, return 1 else zero
- All classes now use @conMod for their surge bonus, no more half a surge for characters with con 15! Stupid javascript type system.
- All classes now set their HP formula to override, because HP auto-calc fields are saved in the actor and the effects directly edit them, having effects that add to them is hilarious and bumps them every time you view that screen and triggered a save.
It should be noted this is still a risk with hp-auto calc and the bonus field.
- Dragonborn racial fixed to modify surge value, not number of surges. Closes Dragonborn Racial applies wrong effect #166
- Elves kneecapped. Previously Elves added 7 to their speed and so went zipping along at speed 13. Set to override.
- Human racial flange of +1 to all defences added to their racial package. I know humans suck, but not giving them their racial defence bonus was really mean. Think of all the poor humans who have died for the lack of +1 ref!
- Updated Basic Melee and Ranged attacks to use a base damage formula of 1 + @Epic so their damage scales automatically
- Poked the @powmax variable in formula helper so it will handle formula in the power base damage multiplier the same as @powbase does.
- Fixed an issue in highlighted rolls because foundry modifies the formula of dice rolls (a few spaces appear and disappear)
- Resurrected @wepDice() to use with high crit weapons
- All SRD high crit weapons have their bonus crit damage put in the bonus crit damage formula and done as @wepDice(@tier) so it just gives them the right number based on their base damage and tier.
- when I entered SRD weapons I somehow missed the 2 handed property. 2 handed wepaons now correctly have the 2H weapon property set so work with the example fighter weapon talent.
- Fixed why implement secondary crit damage could not be deleted [merge](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/178) from [draconas1](https://github.com/draconas1)
