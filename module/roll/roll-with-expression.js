 * Roll that will also have a roll for the expression used to build the row, and highlighting for how elements correspond to formula numbers.
 *
 * When clicking on the resulting formula display, the pop out will now contain the original expression that was used to make that formula. (e.g. formula with the @variables)
 * If the expression can be supplied as an array parts (e.g. ["@wepAttack+@powerMod+@lvhalf", "@bonus"], then it can apply mouseOver highlighting matching each individual expression part to
 * the corresponding part of the formula.  This is relatively trivial for most roles, as most rolls are created as an array of parts, allowing additional option sub-expressions to be easily appended.
 *
 * A further level of highlighting is possible, but more difficult, because many expressions are substituted early in the lifecycle.  By supplying an additional field in the options object, highlighting can be done at the individual @variable level.
 * This requires that the additional formulaInnerData property be set in the options.
 *
 * See the documentation on the constructor for how the parameters have changed.
 *
 * It is highly recommended to use the static member {@link createRoll} method to create new instances of this class as that manages a lot of the constructor arguments for you.

     * e.g. most 4E attack formula replace the base weapon formula before it even gets to the dice, so @wepAtk is already 3 + 1.  If this is not supplied it is defaulted to the formula.
     *
     * To just get the expression displayed, that is sufficient.  To apply highlighting to match variables to data, the following is needed:
     *
     * expressionArr as expression, but this time with terms in an array.  To make use of this the elements of the formula that correspond to each part of the expressionArr should be surrounded in brackets.
     * formulaInnerData a data object of key = value for any @variables that were pre-replaced before the roll was put in the formula.
     *
     * @param formula The formula to roll.  Each section that corresponds to an element in the options.expressionArr array must be surrounded in brackets and must be an outer bracket.
     * @param data The roll data object, unchanged from standard
     * @param options As regular roll options with 2 additional properties:
     * expressionArr as expression, but this time with terms in an array.  To make use of this the elements of the formula that correspond to each part of the expressionArr must be surrounded in brackets.
     * formulaInnerData a data object of key = value for any @variables that were pre-replaced before the roll was put in the formula.
     *
     * Example
     * Attack roll where the attack formula is @wepAtk + @enhance.  In the player form the player specifies a situation bonus of +1d6
     * This goes through formula conversion before getting to the roll converting @wepAtk + @enhance to "3 + 1"
     * When building this roll we have a formula parts array of ["3 + 1], "@bonus"], and expression parts array of ["@wepAtk + @enhance", "@bonus"] a regular roll data object of {"bonus" : "1d6"} and an extra data object of {wepAtk: 3, enhance: 1}
     * const bracketFormula = formulaParts.map(x => `(${x})`).join("+") = (3 + 1)+@bonus

     * Worked example:
     * Attack roll: which is 1d20 + @wepAttack+@powerMod+@lvhalf+@bonus   {wepAttack: "3 + 1", powerMod: 5, lvhalf: 1, bonus: "1d6" }
     * by the time this formula reaches out code it has become a parts array like so ["3 + 1 + 5 + 1", "@bonus"]  This is because item-document.js calls Helper.commonReplace on the attack formula and performs all the substitutions required
     * the @bonus gets added as a new part by the roll helper in dice.js to capture the situational bonus added by the user
     * In order to get a nice expression with highlighting we need to call this method with the following parameters:
     * parts: ["3 + 1 + 5 + 1", "@bonus"]
     * expressionPartsReplacements: [{ target: "3 + 1 + 5 + 1", value: "@wepAttack + @powerMod + @lvhalf"}]
     * data: {bonus: "1d6" }
     * options {
     *     formulaInnerData: {
     *      wepAttack: "3 + 1",
     *      powerMod: 5,
     *      lvhalf: 1
     *    }
     * }
     * @param parts {String[]} The Formula to be rolled as an array of different expressions it is to be built from (e.g. ["2+3+5", "4", "-2", "@bonus"]
     * @param expressionPartsReplacements {Object[]} An array of replacement objects that can be used to find the original variables for any entry in the parts array that has already been substituted.
     * Each object requires 2 fields: target which must contain a string that exactly matches 1 element in the parts array, and value which is the expression that was used to create it: [{ target: "2+3+5", value: "@weapAttack + @enhance"}]
     * If this is not supplied then any pre-substituted formula will show up as their pre-subbed values in both the result and expression display
     * @param data {Object} The roll substitution data, as a normal roll
     * @param options {Object} The roll options.  If you have expressionPartsReplacements for certain parts, in order for highlighting to correctly highlight the individual variables in expressionPartsReplacements,
     * you must set the 'formulaInnerData' property of this to be an object of {name: value} where name is the variable name without the @ and value is the exact value it was substituted for.
     * If this is not supplied highlighting will be at the level of the parts array - mousing over a part of the parts array will highlight all of that part in the expression and result display.
     * Please note that this object is serialised and deserialised to JSON and stored with rolls, it is therefore advisable to keep this as small as possible and not to simply copy the entire contents of the data object.

                 However Foundry's formula parser does not like flavour inside brackets.  e.g. ((1d6 + 5)[fire])
                 And the flavour is dropped entirely, which breaks the resistance calculation.

                 So perform a check to try and determine if the part is entirely a flavoured damage expression.
                 First basic check:
                 - If the part starts with a ( and ends with a ] it is probably a flavoured damage expression.
                 - then perform that godawful regex to make sure that it is the right shape and not someone using [] for random flavouring/clarity

                  There are probably edge-cases here that I am not covering, but worst that happens is the highlighting looks a little weird / doesn't work.
